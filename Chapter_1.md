## Data Basics

### 1. Numerical
- continuous numerical: These variables can take on any number of infinite values given within a given range, are usually measured, such as height.
- discreet numerical:  The variables that take on one of a specific set of numeric values where we're able to count or enumerate all of the possibilities. e.g. the number of cars a household owns.

### 2. Categorical
- ordinal categorical: have an inherent ordering, hence the variable would be called ordinal. very unsatisfied. e.g: unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied and very satisfied.
- categorical: If the levels of a categorical variable do not have an inherent ordering to them then the variable is simply called categorical. For example, are you a morning person or an afternoon person?

##  Observational Studies & Experiments
### 1. observational studies
- In an observational study, researchers collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise. In other words, they merely observe. And based on observational studies, we can only establish an association.  
- For example, In an observational study, we sampled two types of people from the population. Those who choose to work out and those who don't, then find the average energy level for the two groups of people and compare.
- Observational studies for the most part, allow us to make only correlational statements.
### 2. experiments 
- In an experiments, researchers randomly assign subjects to treatments and can, therefore, establish causal connections between the explanatory and response variables. 
- For example, we sample a group of people from the population, then we randomly assign these people into two groups. Those who will regularly work out through the course of the stud and those who will not. 
- In conclusion, experiments, allow to infer causation.
## Sampling and sources of bias
### 1. convenience sample bias
- occurs when individuals who are easily accessible, are more likely to be included in the sample.
### 2. non-response bias
- It  happens if only a non-random fraction of the randomly sampled people respond to a survey, such that the sample is no longer representative of the population.

- For example, if you take a random sample of individuals from your city, and attempt to survey them, but certain segments of the population, say those from a lower socioeconomic status, are less likely to respond to the survey.
### 3. voluntary response bias
- It occurs when the sample consists of only people
who volunteer to respond because they have strong opinions on the issue. 
For example, if you place polling machines at all bus stops and metro stations in your city, but only those who choose to do so actually take the time to vote and express their opinion on the recent increase on public transportation costs.
### 4. difference between voluntary response bias and non-response bias
- In non-response there is a random sample that is surveyed, but the people who choose to respond are not representative of the sample, while in voluntary response there is no initial random sample. 

##  Experimental Design
### 1. four principles of experiment design
- control: compare treatment of interest to a control group
- randomize: means randomly assigning subjects to treatments.
- replicate: means collecting a sufficiently large sample within the study or to replicate the entire study
- block: If there are variables that are know or suspected to effect the response variable, first group the subjects into blocks based on these variables. And then randomized cases with in each block to treatment groups. 

## Random Sampling and Random Assignment
### 1. random sampling
- Random sampling occurs when subjects are being selected for a study. If subjects are selected randomly from the population,then each subject in the population is equally likely to be selected, and
the resulting sample is likely representative of the population.
- A study that uses no random assignment, but
does use random sampling, is your typical observational study. 
- Results can only be used to make correlation statements, but they can be generalized to the population at large
### 2. random assignment
- Random assignment occurs only in experimental settings, where subjects are being assigned to various treatments.
- Random assignment, but not random sampling.
These studies can be used to make causal conclusions, but the conclusions only apply to the sample, and the results cannot be generalized.
