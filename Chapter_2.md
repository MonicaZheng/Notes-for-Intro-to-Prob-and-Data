##  Exploring Numerical Variables
###  Visualizing Numerical Data
### 1. data distribution
- skewness: In a left skewed distribution, the longer tail is on the left on the negative end. In a right skewed distribution, the longer tail is on the right, the positive end.
- modality: A distribution might be unimodal with one prominent peak, bimodal with two prominent peaks, or uniform with no prominent peaks.
With more than two prominent peaks a distribution is usually said to be multimodal.
### 2. visualization techniques
- histogram: In a histogram, data are binned into intervals and height of the bars represent the number of cases that fall into each interval.
In other words a histogram provides a view of the data density, higher bars represent where data are relatively more common.
- box plot: A box plot  readily displace outliers. the median, the thick line inside the box, and the interquartile range, the width of the box. 
Box plot can also be used to display the skewness. The peak of the distribution will be roughly around the median, and the tails will extend out to the tails in the box plot.

###  Measures of Center
### 1. Left skewed distributions: 
In the left skewed distributions, the mean is generally smaller than the median.
Since the few low valued observations pull the average down.
### 2. symmetric distributions:
In symmetric distributions the mean and the median are now roughly equal to each other.
### 3.  right skewed distributions
In right skewed distributions, the mean is generally higher than the median since the few high valued observations pulled the average up.

###  Measures of Spread
### 1. variance 
- The units of the variance, is the square of the units of the original data.
### 2. standard deviation
- square root of the variation
### 3. interquartile range
- IQR is the difference between Q1 and Q3.
- IQR is a more reliable measure of spread in sample data than the range, which is maximum minus minimum. The reason is that doesn't rely on the endpoints, which may be unusual observations or potential outliers.

## Exploring Categorical Variables and Introduction to Inference
###  Exploring Categorical Variables
### 1. bar plot
- different between histograms?
First, bar plots are used for displaying distributions of categorical variables, while histograms are used for numerical variables. Second, the axis in a histogram is a number line. Hence, the orders of the bars cannot be changed. While in a bar plot, the categories can be listed in any order.
### 3. segmented bar plot
- Segmented bar plots are useful for visualizing conditional frequency distributions. In other words, the distribution of the levels of one variable, the response variable, conditioned on the levels of the other, the explanatory variable.
### 4. relative frequencies bar plot
- lists each category of data and the number of occurrences for each category.

### 5. mosaic plot
- displays the distribution of feelings about difficulty of saving money, conditional on income as well. It also shows the marginal distribution of income, too
### 6. contingency table
- A contingency table is a special type of frequency distribution table,  where two variables are shown simultaneously.
